The goal of this project is to emulate the natural handwriting of a person.

Currently the model trains on the MNIST database and is able to produce quality
looking numbers.

In the future I would like to automatically pull images from the 
Library of Congress of the writings of Thomas Jefferson, as there is a large
enough sample set from a single person that good quality training could be
performed.
